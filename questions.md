* What even is a git?
* What is a github, then?
* Something better for binary? large file support?
* Private vs public repositories?
* Explain forks
    * Forks are how people can use one repository as a starting point for their own, even if their version goes in a wildly different direction.
    * Forks are how people who can't write to a repository can offer updates to that repository anyway.
      * Especially with large open-source projects, it is common for users of a project to find a bug or strongly desire a feature. While they could submit a bug/feature request, some people have both the time and technical expertice to fix the bug or implement the feature; they can fork the project, fix the bug/implement the feature on their own fork, then submit that work back to the original project in a Pull Request. The original project's owners, then, can choose whether or not to accept that work.
   * Forks allow once-dead projects to come back to life.
      * If the original project is unmaintaned for long enough, someone may make a fork of the project and continue to maintain it for the community.
