# Questions

* What even is a git?
  * Git is a Distributed Version Control System:
      * As a **Version Control System**, git helps track changes to files over time, lets people work on the same files without clobbering each others' changes, and lets people work on large changes to multiple files and have all of those changes apply to the file set at once.
      * As a **Distributed** system, git can operate without having a central server that all of the people using a git repository have to be able to use. Git repositories can be shared in a peer-to-peer system as well as in a more traditional client/server way.

* Something better for binary? large file support?
* Private vs public repositories?
